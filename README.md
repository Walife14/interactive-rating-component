## Overview

Created this project to work on desktop and mobile responsiveness on websites. with this challenge I hope to put the design as accurately as possible and being fully responsive.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- JavaScript (DOM)

### What I learned

During this challenge I have learned about different gradient properties such as the radial gradient and how it works.

I have also learned about how to style radio buttons and how to get the value from them and save it to a variable - it was quite simple but I had to look it up online in order to find the solution to find the checked radio button.

### Continued development

I believe that something I would like to improve on is styling radio buttons for forms and getting better at sizing fonts.

I've recently studied SCSS, and completing this challenge using CSS has shown me that SCSS can help organise the code and allow it to have a 'cleaner' look - especially long-term with larger code.

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/radial-gradient) - Has allowed me to create a 'radial-gradient' - something that I did not know existed.
